I  created an interactive Timeline website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJs).  You can add events to the timeline which are stored  in a MongoDB database. The node js and express  server  fetches this  data in the MongoDB  database and  sends the data back to the client where it renders it with React Js. In addition to that, the client draws the timeline on an html  canvas element using its javascript library.
